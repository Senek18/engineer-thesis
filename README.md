The purpose of the engineering project was to prepare and compare the effectiveness of five
machine learning models based on the algorithms:
1) linear regression
2) decision tree
3) random forest
4) boosting decision tree
5) neural network

Forecasting concerned four forms of energy in the form of ice water,
electricity, hot water and steam.

The data used in the engineering project was provided by
American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers
in a competition organized on the Kaggle website. The dataset can be found at
https://www.kaggle.com/c/ashrae-energy-prediction/overview. The organization made available
five interested files in which information about over 1000 was collected
buildings from a three-year period. # engineer-thesis
