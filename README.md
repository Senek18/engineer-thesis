The purpose of the engineering project was to prepare and compare the effectiveness of five
machine learning models based on the algorithms :
1) linear regression
2) decision tree
3) random forest
4) boosting decision tree
5) neural network
Forecasting concerned four forms of energy in the form of ice water,
electricity, hot water and steam. # engineer-thesis
